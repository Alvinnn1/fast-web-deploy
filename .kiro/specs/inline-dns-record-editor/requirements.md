# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the DNS record management interface in the DomainDetail view by allowing users to add new DNS records directly inline below the existing records list. Instead of opening a separate modal, users will be able to create new DNS records in an intuitive, streamlined editing interface that appears directly in the DNS records section.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want to add new DNS records directly in the DNS records list, so that I can quickly create records without interrupting my workflow with modal dialogs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "添加记录" (Add Record) button THEN the system SHALL display an inline editing form below the existing DNS records
2. WHEN the inline editing form is displayed THEN the system SHALL show input fields for record type, name, content, TTL, and proxy settings
3. WHEN the user is adding a new record THEN the system SHALL validate all input fields according to DNS record type requirements
4. WHEN the user saves a valid new record THEN the system SHALL submit the record to the API and add it to the records list
5. WHEN the user cancels adding a new record THEN the system SHALL hide the inline form and return to the normal view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want the new record form to have the same validation and functionality as the existing edit form, so that I have a consistent experience across all DNS record operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a record type THEN the system SHALL show appropriate placeholder text for the content field
2. WHEN the user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors inline with the form fields
3. WHEN the record type is A or AAAA THEN the system SHALL show the proxy toggle option
4. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL validate all fields before making the API call
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight the invalid fields

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want visual feedback during the record creation process, so that I understand the current state of my action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks save THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the save button
2. WHEN the API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable form inputs to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN the record is successfully created THEN the system SHALL hide the inline form and refresh the records list
4. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the form open for correction
5. WHEN there are no existing records THEN the system SHALL still allow adding new records through the same inline interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want to delete DNS records that are no longer needed, so that I can keep my DNS configuration clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the delete button on a DNS record THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL call the API to delete the record
3. WHEN the deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL remove the record from the list immediately
4. IF the deletion fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and keep the record in the list
5. WHEN the deletion is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading state and disable the delete button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want to be able to add multiple records in sequence, so that I can efficiently set up multiple DNS configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new record is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL automatically show a fresh inline form for adding another record
2. WHEN the user wants to stop adding records THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to close the inline form
3. WHEN multiple records are being added THEN the system SHALL maintain the scroll position to keep the form visible
4. WHEN the user navigates away from the page THEN the system SHALL not lose any unsaved form data without warning
5. WHEN the form is active THEN the system SHALL prevent other DNS record edit operations to avoid conflicts
