# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues that occur when the frontend directly calls Cloudflare's asset upload APIs. Currently, the frontend makes direct API calls to `https://api.cloudflare.com` for checking missing assets and uploading assets, which results in CORS errors. The solution is to move these API calls to the backend, creating proxy endpoints that the frontend can call without CORS issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the application, I want asset upload operations to work without CORS errors, so that I can successfully upload files to Cloudflare Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs to check for missing assets THEN the system SHALL provide a backend endpoint that proxies the request to Cloudflare's API
2. WHEN the frontend needs to upload assets THEN the system SHALL provide a backend endpoint that proxies the request to Cloudflare's API
3. WHEN the backend receives asset-related requests THEN the system SHALL forward them to the appropriate Cloudflare API endpoints with proper authentication
4. WHEN the Cloudflare API responds THEN the system SHALL return the response to the frontend in the same format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to call backend endpoints instead of external APIs directly, so that I don't have to deal with CORS configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making asset check requests THEN the frontend SHALL call a local backend endpoint instead of the Cloudflare API directly
2. WHEN making asset upload requests THEN the frontend SHALL call a local backend endpoint instead of the Cloudflare API directly
3. WHEN calling backend endpoints THEN the system SHALL use the same request/response format as the original Cloudflare API calls
4. IF the backend proxy fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle all external API authentication, so that sensitive tokens are not exposed to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend makes requests to Cloudflare THEN the system SHALL use the JWT token provided by the frontend in the Authorization header
2. WHEN forwarding requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the same authentication mechanism as the original implementation
3. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive token information in error responses
