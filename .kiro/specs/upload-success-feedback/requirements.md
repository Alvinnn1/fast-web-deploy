# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the upload experience by providing immediate feedback when a file upload is successful. When an upload completes and returns a URL and deployment_id, the system will display the URL immediately and then automatically check the deployment status after 2 seconds to update the UI accordingly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the deployment URL immediately after a successful upload, so that I can quickly access my deployed content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload completes successfully AND returns a URL THEN the system SHALL display the URL in the upload modal
2. WHEN the URL is displayed THEN the system SHALL make it clickable for easy access
3. WHEN the URL is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation that the upload was successful

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically check deployment status after upload, so that I can see the current state of my deployment without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload completes successfully AND returns a deployment_id THEN the system SHALL wait 2 seconds before checking deployment status
2. WHEN the 2-second delay completes THEN the system SHALL call the deployment status API with the deployment_id
3. WHEN the deployment status is retrieved THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding PageItem UI to reflect the current status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PageItem UI to reflect the latest deployment status, so that I can see real-time updates of my deployment progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment status is retrieved THEN the system SHALL update the PageItem component with the new status
2. WHEN the PageItem is updated THEN the system SHALL show appropriate visual indicators (loading, success, error states)
3. IF the deployment status indicates completion THEN the system SHALL show the final deployment URL in the PageItem
4. IF the deployment status indicates an error THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the upload modal to remain open briefly after success, so that I can see the immediate results before it closes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upload succeeds and URL is displayed THEN the modal SHALL remain open for user review
2. WHEN the user clicks outside the modal or presses escape THEN the modal SHALL close normally
3. WHEN the modal closes THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring deployment status in the background
